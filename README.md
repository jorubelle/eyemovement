The eyeball follows the mouse!

In this excersize, I was learning about combining Javascript and CSS to create the illusion that they eyes follow your mouse.  I used Javascript to have the pupils follow the mouse. I created a mouse event to work with the DOM elements. 

This was a fun activity to work on.
